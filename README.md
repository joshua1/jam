JAM - Just App Menu is a simple "Facebook-like" menu for Sencha Touch 2. 
It is based on wnielson's menu https://github.com/wnielson/sencha-SlideNavigation, but made more simple by decoupling logic and markup that binds menu items with actual views.

JAM provides you just a container for your menu and app contents - you can pretty much stuff any kind of app inside of it, as long as your menu contents and app contents are separate views. 
So it is you who handles menu buttons events and shuffling screens in content section - JAM just gives you a nice open/close transition between menu and content sections of your app.  

You get only bare essentials you need:

*  Main Container view/controller - these hold config params and logic to build side menu  
*  Couple of demo views and controllers to get you started

You can configure following options:

*  Turn on/off dragging to open
*  A specific component class reacting to drag 
*  Slide entry/exit speeds
